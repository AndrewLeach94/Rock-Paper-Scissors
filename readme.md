# Rock, Paper, Scissors
## User Story: 
As a user, I want to be able to play a game of rock, paper, and scissors against a computer.

### Play game:
https://andrewleach94.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/


#### Overview
Play against the computer with a simple game of rock, paper, scissors. There is no front-end to the programme - yet - so you will play using the console. This project will be gradually updated to improve the overall UX by adding an attractive user interface.

Start your game by typing `goal()` into the browser console.

##### Checklist

- [x] Develop the core backend component of the game - (8/18/2020)
- [ ] Develop a basic user interface to remove need of the console
- [ ] Design and develop the final UI
